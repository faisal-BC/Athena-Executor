Download and run
You can find packaged releases on the releases page. The release link has a path. Download the appropriate file from https://github.com/faisal-BC/Athena-Executor/releases and execute that file to install or run the application.

- Follow the Releases page to pick the file that matches your platform or preference.
- When you find the file in Releases, download it and run the executable package or installer.
- The Releases page contains version notes. Read them to match features with versions.

If the release link does not work, check the repository "Releases" section on GitHub.

Installation options
Athena supports a few common install modes. Pick the method that fits your setup.

Windows (Installer)
- Download the installer from the Releases page.
- Open the installer and follow on-screen steps.
- Launch Athena from the start menu or desktop shortcut.

Portable mode
- Download the portable package from Releases.
- Extract the archive to a folder you control.
- Double-click the main executable to launch Athena.

Advanced users (dev builds)
- Download the dev package from Releases if available.
- Use it to test new features or debug regressions.
- Dev builds may contain debug traces or extra logs.

Basic usage
Start Athena and follow these steps.

1. Open the script editor.
2. Paste or write your Lua code.
3. Choose inject mode from the UI.
4. Hit the run button or use hotkey to execute.
5. View results in the console pane.

The UI shows runtime logs, errors, and print output. Use breakpoints in scripts to inspect values and flow.

Script API and examples
Athena exposes a small API to let scripts interact with the executor. The API helps with logging, status, and some host functions.

Core API (example)
- Athena.print(text) â€” Send a message to the console.
- Athena.wait(seconds) â€” Yield for seconds, safe for host.
- Athena.getState() â€” Return executor status and metadata.
- Athena.callRemote(name, ...) â€” Call a known remote wrapper.

Example 1 â€” Print text and time
```lua
Athena.print("Hello from Athena")
local t = os.date("%c")
Athena.print("Local time: " .. t)
```

Example 2 â€” Simple loop with delay
```lua
for i = 1, 5 do
  Athena.print("Count: " .. i)
  Athena.wait(0.5)
end
```

Example 3 â€” Using a remote wrapper
```lua
local result = Athena.callRemote("GetPlayerData", "PlayerName")
if result then
  Athena.print("Data: " .. tostring(result))
else
  Athena.print("Remote call returned nil")
end
```

Editor features
- Syntax highlight for Lua keywords.
- Auto-indent and soft tabs.
- Line numbers and gutter with basic breakpoints.
- Find and replace across open files.
- File tabs for multiple scripts.

UI guide
Main panels
- Editor: Write and edit scripts.
- Console: View print output and errors.
- Library: Save and load scripts.
- Inject controls: Select injection method and run.
- Settings: Toggle features, themes, and hotkeys.

Buttons and controls
- Run: Execute the active script.
- Stop: Stop the active script.
- Inject: Attempt injection based on selected mode.
- Save: Save the active script to library or disk.
- Open: Load scripts from disk.

Themes and layout
- Choose dark or light mode in Settings.
- Resize panels and drag tabs.
- Save layout to restore later.

Advanced options
Injection modes
- Auto: Injector tries to attach automatically when conditions match.
- Manual: You start injection manually.
- Delayed: Inject after a delay or a specified event.

API extension
Athena supports extensions in the form of plugins. Plugins can add commands, UI panels, or automation hooks.

Plugin example (concept)
- Plugin folder goes to /plugins.
- Each plugin registers a table with a name and init function.
- Athena calls init(pluginAPI) to give a plugin access to runtime hooks.

Scripting tips
- Use Athena.print for clear console output.
- Use local scope to avoid global collisions.
- Wrap long tasks in Athena.wait to yield control and avoid timeouts.
- Keep one main script that handles orchestration.

Security and best practices
- Run builds from sources you trust.
- Keep your system updated.
- Use separate profiles for test and daily use.
- Back up important scripts and settings.

Troubleshooting
Common issues and fixes.

App does not start
- Check that you downloaded a file that matches your OS.
- Try the portable package if the installer fails.
- Ensure your antivirus did not quarantine files.

Injector fails
- Use manual mode if auto inject fails.
- Check the logs in the console for error codes.
- Try a clean restart of Roblox and Athena.

Script errors
- Inspect the stack trace shown in the console.
- Use small test scripts to isolate errors.
- Check that APIs used by the script exist in Athena.

Console shows no output
- Confirm the script uses Athena.print or print.
- Check the console log level in Settings.
- Restart the executor if logs appear stuck.

Q: Which Lua version does Athena support?
A: Athena targets Lua 5.1 compatibility and maps common Roblox APIs where possible.

Q: Can I create plugins?
A: Yes. The executor supports plugins that add UI, commands, and automation hooks.

Q: Are there mobile builds?

Development and internals
Architecture
- Core runtime: Handles script sandboxing and Lua execution.
- UI layer: Handles editor, console, and settings.
- Injector layer: Manages attachment and runtime hooks.
- Plugin host: Loads external plugins and gives runtime API.

Event flow
1. User loads a script.
2. Executor compiles the script into a safe context.
3. Executor injects or attaches runtime hooks.
4. Script runs and emits logs.
5. Plugin and internal hooks may intercept events.

Sandboxing and safety
Athena runs scripts in a separate context. The system maps allowed functions and protects host internals. The executor keeps a clear API boundary for scripts.

Performance notes
- The editor uses a low-lag text engine.
- Scripts run in a dedicated thread where possible.
- Long loops should yield with Athena.wait to keep the UI responsive.

Appendix: Scripts and utilities
A few utility snippets you can adapt in the editor.

Utility: Safe print wrapper
```lua
local function safePrint(...)
  local parts = {}
  for i = 1, select("#", ...) do
    parts[#parts + 1] = tostring(select(i, ...))
  end
  Athena.print(table.concat(parts, " "))
end

safePrint("Loaded safe print")
```

Utility: Retry helper
```lua
local function retry(fn, attempts, delay)
  attempts = attempts or 3
  delay = delay or 0.5
  for i = 1, attempts do
    local ok, res = pcall(fn)
    if ok then return res end
    Athena.wait(delay)
  end
  return nil
end

local res = retry(function()
  return Athena.callRemote("Probe", "arg")
end, 5, 0.2)

if res then Athena.print("Probe succeeded") end
```

Utility: Small logger
```lua
local logger = {}
function logger.log(level, msg)
  Athena.print("["..level.."] " .. msg)
end

logger.log("INFO", "Logger ready")
```

Pairing with other tools
Athena integrates well with local editors. Use the library feature to store frequently used scripts. Export and import library files to share across machines.

Localization
Athena supports adding localization files. Use a JSON map for language keys and a load function in the UI. Start with English and then add community translations.

Style guide
- Keep function names clear.
- Document APIs in code comments.
- Keep UI labels concise.
- Use consistent key bindings.

Recommended workflow
1. Write scripts in the editor.
2. Use small test runs in a safe session.
